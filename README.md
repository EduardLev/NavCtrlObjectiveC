Turn To Tech Navigation Controller Project

# Description

The user can add, edit and update companies and products across several table view controllers. The user can also navigate to product websites for more information. Main table view also includes stock prices.

This project utilized Navigation Controller, Table Views, WKWebView, Core Data, NSURLSession, JSON handling, etc. Initial application build used regular data models, and a Core Data layer with managed objects was added on a refactor to handle persistence of user data. ARC was turned off for this project, so all memory management was handled manually. The XCode instruments tool was used to find & debug memory leaks. Core Data Manager also provides undo and redo ability for user actions.
