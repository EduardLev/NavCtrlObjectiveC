// This model controller 'CompanyModelController' contains the data for the model objects
// used in this application. It also provides methods for modifying those model objects such
// as adding and removing products and companies. It is also responsible for initilizing itself
// from data on the disk or in Core Data. The other controllers in this project must
// create a property that links to the shared instance of this object, which will allow them
// to access the data stored.
